# steam-join-all-profiles-groups
This is a script that when you load it, it will join every group on someone's profile. Good for mass joining, that's about it.

# How to use
1. If on Chrome install Tampermonkey here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
- If on Firefox install Greasemonkey here https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/
- If on Opera install Violentmonkey here https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/
2. Click on my modified script in this repository and press "Raw". If you are on chrome, it should give you the option to save in tampermonkey.
3. When you have the script installed, just load up someone's steam profile, and wait. You will slowly start joining all of their groups.
