## steam-join-all-profiles-groups
This is a script for mass joining Steam groups, by loading a users profile and automatically joining all of the groups they're in.

## How to use
Install one of these extensions for your browser:
<br />
Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
<br />
Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
<br />
Opera: [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)

Go [here](https://github.com/KniferFTW/steam-join-all-profiles-groups/blob/master/steam-join-all-profiles-groups.user.js) and click "Raw".
<br />
If you are on chrome, it should give you the option to install into tampermonkey.

When you have the script installed, just load up someone's steam profile, and wait.
<br />
You will slowly start joining all of their groups.
<br />
(You may need to refresh the page for it to join more.)
